<!-- Run setup command -->
Two packages we have to install from priscmic.io
First is the slice machine , second  is the prismic/next


<!-- Configure Prismic -->
then we have to create prismicio.js file
and copy & paste the code present in docs 

<!-- Add <PrismicProvider> and <PrismicPreview> -->

then we add prism provider and prismic preview 
just copy and paste code in _app.js 
which is present in prismic docs 


<!-- Create Slice Simulator page -->
create a slice-simulator.jsx
copy & paste the code from docs its 
allows us to separate slicers i guess 

<!-- sm.json -->
copy and paste the URL in sm.json



<!-- lets Start -->
npm run dev  && npm run slicemachine
